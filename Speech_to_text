# Objective
The primary objective of this internship assignment is to evaluate your proficiency in natural
language processing by developing a highly accurate transcription model for the Marathi
language. This entails creating a robust model that can accurately transcribe spoken
Marathi content. You will be provided with a test dataset, and you are encouraged to use
open source datasets to enhance the model's performance and training.

# Data
Please download the assignment folder from here.
Audio files and corresponding transcriptions are stored in a designated folder.
- The provided folder contains audio files and a text file that includes the names of the
audio files along with their respective transcriptions.

# Output
1. Metric Selection: Carefully choose and justify the use of appropriate metrics that
optimise the model's performance.
2. Model Development: Implement a state-of-the-art natural language processing model
for transcription. You can leverage any existing architecture.
3. Code Implementation: Provide clear and well-commented code that demonstrates the
implementation of the transcription model. Ensure that your code is organised, efficient, and
easy to follow.
4. Comprehensive Documentation: Accompany your code with comprehensive
documentation that guides readers through the transcription model implementation
process. Include detailed explanations of the model selection, data preprocessing
techniques, training methodology, and hyperparameter tuning. Provide instructions for
replicating your results.
5. Testing and Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using the designated test
dataset. Report the results using the chosen metrics, and discuss the model's strengths and
limitations.

# Note
You are permitted to utilise any open-source data for training purposes, excluding the data
we have provided.

# Result
The result shows the transcribe audio and Evaulation metric of the model Word Error Rate(Wer) compared to the given reference file
